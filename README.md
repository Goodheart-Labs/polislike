# polislike

This repo contains various experiments by [Goodheart Labs](https://goodheartlabs.com/) with [Polis](https://pol.is/), a community preferences tool.

## Theory: If responses were easier to give, the polls would be more useful

The `shuffle` directory contains a Next.js app that wraps the respondent frontend for Polis with a simpler card UI.
